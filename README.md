Scripts for importing and maintaining your personal arcade in N:RAN

From working install, steps to take:
# Download latest yt-dlp and overwrite old youtube-dl file
# Download latest retroarch core nightlies

# Try disabling more ASLR settings
# Try Genesis Plus GX core?

# (Optional) Remove assorted trash
## in New Retro Arcade Neon\NewRetroArcade\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor directory, open GameUserSettings and remove trash

## Potential problem: if we're generating completely correct CSVs and Arcade
Manager still doesn't like them, there's not much else to do besides make our
own XMLs?
